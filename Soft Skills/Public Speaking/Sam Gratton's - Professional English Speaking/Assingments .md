### Speech

```asciidoc
Hello there, fellow travelers in this enlightening journey, I’m here today to talk about a certain book, a book that fascinate my younger self and help me to adcquire both patience when judging a situation and perseverance to pursue the truth, I’m talking about “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes”
It was written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle more than a century ago (in 1892), “Seriously? Are you recommending a title with more than a hundred years?”

Well, yes I am, and that should give you a hint on how deep touched my heart this book.

But, let's say something about the plot itself, the story follows an unconventional detective and his most close friend in a myriad of cases that challenge the imagination of the reader, I'm not going to spoil anything relevant as the least I want is to steal from you the pleasure to share step by step the findings of this duo.

As a last words, allow me to make a some reflection, this book is full of mistery and adventure, in fact, that's it's genre in the library, but for me it's speaking of curiosity, persistence and most importantly team play, no matter how smart you are you'll always improve if you count with another one's point of view.

Please remember, the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, you are not going to regret it.
