### Speech

```asciidoc
Hello there, fellow travelers in this enlightening journey, I’m here today to talk about a certain book, a book that fascinate my younger self and help me to adcquire both patience when judging a situation and perseverance to pursue the truth, I’m talking about “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes”
It was written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle more than a century ago (in 1892), “Seriously? Are you recommending a title with more than a hundred years?”

Well, yes I am, and that should give you a hint on how deep touched my heart this book.

But, let's say something about the plot itself, the story follows an unconventional detective and his most close friend in a myriad of cases that challenge the imagination of the reader, I'm not going to spoil anything relevant as the least I want is to steal from you the pleasure to share step by step the findings of this duo.

As a last words, allow me to make a some reflection, this book is full of mistery and adventure, in fact, that's it's genre in the library, but for me it's speaking of curiosity, persistence and most importantly team play, no matter how smart you are you'll always improve if you count with another one's point of view.

Please remember, the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, you are not going to regret it.

#### Feedback: 
- Stick to the time limit

## Task 3: Convice us to... Invite my partner for a coffe (live):

```asciidoc
Hello friends, let me ask you something, Since working remotely have you been feeling more lonely? isolated? Somewhat disconnected from most of the people you work with? If its a yes, you're not alone, what otherwise were pleasant moments of connection between pairs when grabbing a coffe, having small talk in a corridor or in the lunch time are now moments of solitude in your room.

The problem is that we are often too shy, or too worried to bother someone with an spontaneus virtual conversation, But I've come here with a solution for it, a solution that has name, the name is Diego and I want you to schedule a virtual cofee with him.

I will go straight to the point and give you 3 reasons you should do that:

I can start saying that Diego is a kind and friendly developer that displays an incredible domain over the digital world, he worked across several teams within the company so if you have any doubt about our product inner workings, he's your man.

I will continue with some of his hobbies, as an sportive person he likes to play & watch several sports including football and basket, so you can talk about the last match or even ask for a pachanga if you're nearby, preferably in the outside as he enjoys being surrounded by nature.

And to finish, have you ever thought on parenthood? If you have any doubts about it, I want to highlight how an amazing father he is, having a little daughter he worries to give her an informed education, quality time and on top of that love.

Seems like a keeper, right? Please don't wait! Hurry now before all Diego's coffee calendar slots are booked!
```

## Task 4: Business Speech... The importance of quality:

```asciidoc
Good morning, have you ever had to deal with stress? with burnout? with an oppresive, asphyxiant and drowning work environment?

Thank you for joining me today as we discuss a topic close to my heart whose lack is what causes the situations previously described, I'm talking about quality, and I want to make sure you understand it's importance.

Let me start assesing What is quality? 
- Quality is excellence, the continuous improvement mindset focused on delivering the best effort that we're capable of.
- Quality is team play, is not a singular effort but the collective commitment of each team member.
- Quality is patience, as it's not an sprint but a marathon.

However, it is not enough with simply assembling a group of talented individuals, the own organization must embrace the quality path by fostering an environment of trust, respect and open communication. It is through this elements that quality emerges when different perspectives converge, challenges are overcome and innovation thrives.

Furthermore, a work team empowered by the organization and driven by quality would take feedback received not as a sword of blame, but as an opportunity for growth by analizing their processes, identifying ineficiencies and seeking innovative solutions.

Finally, the impact of quality is not a one day flower, it extends through time bringing customer satisfaction, loyalty and stability but the best of it is that all of those elements are shared by the own workforce.

In conclusion, dear colleagues, although complex to measure, quality is an aspiration, a principle that allows teams to be fueled with passion, innovation and a deep sense of pride.
And the lack of it can be tempting to achieve faster short-term goals but you would be only looking at the present at the expense of your future.
Togheter, we can invest in quality, we can invest in greatness, we can invest in us.
